// both cases the caller demonstrably never held the value. A pipe is written by
// whoever built the pipeline — if that is an agent, the agent had the value
// before warden did, and no amount of care on this side changes that.
//
// It is supported because a human at their own terminal is not that caller, and
// for them the convenience is real. The CLI names this channel in its output so
// the weaker guarantee is visible in a transcript rather than assumed.
